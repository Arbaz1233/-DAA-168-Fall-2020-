What is Brute Force Algorithm?
Brute Force Algorithms are exactly what they sound like â€“ straightforward methods of solving a problem that rely on sheer computing power and trying every possibility rather than advanced techniques to improve efficiency. For example, imagine you have a small padlock with 4 digits.

Problem Facing:
Brute Force Algorithm is easy to implement code are easily available. But the comparison one algorithms code not available so the problem will be there on comparison. 

Conclusion:
Brute force search is the most common search algorithm as it does not require any domain knowledge, all that is required is a state description, legal operators, the initial state and the description of a goal state. It does not improve the performance and completely relies on the computing power to try out possible combinations.
